# Upgrade Guide

## 2.x to 3.0

### Soft Deletes

Previously if no soft deletes field was set on an adapter, the JSON API field would default to the dash-case
version of the soft deletes column on the model. For example, if the model used the column `deleted_at`,
the JSON API field would default to `deleted-at`.

In `v3`, the default is now the camel-case version of the column: i.e. `deleted_at` on the model would default
to `deletedAt` for the JSON API field. This change has been made because the JSON API spec has changed its
recommendation from using dash-case to camel-case.

If you have existing resources that use dash-case, simply set the `softDeleteField` property on your adapter,
for example:

```php
use CloudCreativity\LaravelJsonApi\Eloquent\AbstractAdapter;
use CloudCreativity\LaravelJsonApi\Eloquent\Concerns\SoftDeletesModels;

class Adapter extends AbstractAdapter
{

    use SoftDeletesModels;

    protected $softDeleteField = 'deleted-at';

}
```

## 1.x to 2.0

Version 2 drops support for all 5.x and 6.x versions of Laravel, and sets the minimum PHP version to 7.2.
This is because Laravel 7 introduced a few changes (primarily to the exception handler and the namespace
of the test response class) that meant it was not possible to support Laravel 6 and 7.

This release is primarily a tidy-up release: we have removed all functionality that has been marked
as deprecated since the 1.0 pre-releases. Upgrading should be simple if you are not using any of the
deprecated pre-release features.

The following are some notes on additional upgrade steps.

### Errors

If you were type-hinting our error class, it has been moved from `Document\Error` to `Document\Error\Error`.
In addition, the `Validation\ErrorTranslator` class has been moved to `Document\Error\Translator`.

This will only affect applications that have customised error responses.

### Testing

The method signature of the test `jsonApi()` helper method on the `MakesJsonApiRequests` trait has been changed.
This now accepts no function arguments and returns a test builder instance that allows you to fluidly construct test
requests.

For example this on your test case:

```php
$response = $this->jsonApi('GET', '/api/v1/posts', ['include' => 'author']);
```

Is now:

```php
$response = $this
    ->jsonApi()
    ->includePaths('author')
    ->get('/api/v1/posts');
```

> Have a look at the `Testing/TestBuilder` class for the full list of methods you can use when building
> a test request.

All other test methods have been left on the `MakesJsonApiRequests` have been left, but we have marked a number
as deprecated. These deprecated methods will be removed in 3.0 in preference of using method chaining from the
`jsonApi()` method.

#### Test Query Parameters

As per [this issue](https://github.com/cloudcreativity/laravel-json-api/issues/427), we now fail a test if
any query parameters values are not strings, integers or floats. This is because query parameters are received
over HTTP as strings, so for example testing a `true` boolean is invalid and can lead to tests incorrectly
passing.
